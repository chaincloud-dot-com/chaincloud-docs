********************************************************************************

ChainCloud has a flexible pricing model suitable from small business to large enterprise.

Basic Pricing
================================================================================

The basic pricing model is designed to scale with your business :

* 0.10% per incoming tx
    * Truncate to mBTC
    * Pay only for what you use
    * Real-time fee reporting
* volume based discounts available
    * ChainCloud offers everything needed to run a business at scale

Account Pricing
================================================================================

The account pricing model is fixed. You can pay once, and use always :

* 20 mBTC per account
    * One Cold Receiving Token
    * One Hot Sending Token
    * One ChainCloud-V account

Address Pricing
================================================================================

The address pricing model is based on how many addresses used by your business :

* 10 mBTC per batch of addresses
    * Each batch has 1,000 addresses
    * Both Hot/Cold addresses are using this pricing model
    * Actually Hot addresses are not used as much as Cold addresses, because you only need Hot addresses when the fund in Hot wallet is not enough
    * Change addresses are not counted in this pricing model
